type, 
category,Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.  * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.  * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example  a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`  `biolink:GeneProduct`  `biolink:MolecularEntity`  ... In an RDF database  nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class  or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example  a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site  which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity  biolink:MolecularEntity  biolink:NamedThing}

transcript to gene relationship,A gene is a collection of transcripts
gene to gene product relationship,A gene is transcribed and potentially translated to a gene product
exon to transcript relationship,A transcript is formed from multiple exons
chemical entity or gene or gene product regulates gene association,A regulatory relationship between two genes
anatomical entity to anatomical entity association, 
anatomical entity to anatomical entity part of association,A relationship between two anatomical entities where the relationship is mereological  i.e the two entities are related by parthood. This includes relationships between cellular components and cells  between cells and tissues  tissues and whole organisms
anatomical entity to anatomical entity ontogenic association,A relationship between two anatomical entities where the relationship is ontogenic  i.e. the two entities are related by development. A number of different relationship types can be used to specify the precise nature of the relationship.
organism taxon to entity association,An association between an organism taxon and another entity
organism taxon to organism taxon association,A relationship between two organism taxon nodes
organism taxon to organism taxon specialization,A child-parent relationship between two taxa. For example: Homo sapiens subclass_of Homo
organism taxon to organism taxon interaction,An interaction relationship between two taxa. This may be a symbiotic relationship (encompassing mutualism and parasitism)  or it may be non-symbiotic. Example: plague transmitted_by flea; cattle domesticated_by Homo sapiens; plague infects Homo sapiens
organism taxon to environment association,
