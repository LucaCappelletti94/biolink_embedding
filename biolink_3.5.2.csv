 ,type, 
type,category,Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.  * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.  * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example  a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`  `biolink:GeneProduct`  `biolink:MolecularEntity`  ... In an RDF database  nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class  or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example  a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site  which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity  biolink:MolecularEntity  biolink:NamedThing}
